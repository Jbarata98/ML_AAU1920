Experiment with different NN architectures (also varying the convolutional parameters: size, stride, padding, etc) and observe the effect wrt. the loss/accuracy on the training and validation dataset (training, validation). Note that when adding new layers (including dropout [Lecture 1, Slide 32], pooling [Lecture 2, Slide 22], etc.) you need to make sure that the dimensionality of the layers match up. **IMPORTANT:** ignore the test set at this stage (i.e., comment out the relevant lines above) so that the results for the test set do not influence your model choice.\n",
    "3. In the model above we use a simple gradient descent learning scheme. Try other types of optimizers (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) and analyze the effect.\n",
    "4. Lastly save your preferred model and send it to me (tdn@cs.aau.dk). At the next lecture we will then see who got the best results :-) Note that for this to be meaningful it is important that you have not relyed on the test set while doing model learning/selection."
