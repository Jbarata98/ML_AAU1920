Experiment with different NN architectures (also varying the convolutional parameters: size, stride, padding, etc) and observe the effect wrt. the loss/accuracy on the training and validation dataset (training, validation). Note that when adding new layers (including dropout [Lecture 1, Slide 32], pooling [Lecture 2, Slide 22], etc.) you need to make sure that the dimensionality of the layers match up. **IMPORTANT:** ignore the test set at this stage (i.e., comment out the relevant lines above) so that the results for the test set do not influence your model choice.\n",
